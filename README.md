# odin-recipes
HTML-practice page
Hey, this is my first project on the Odin Project. So far I have learned to use the command line to make directories and files, move them around, and change their contents. I had a brief intro to using git and am able to create new repositories on github and move them to my local machine. Ill be trying to use more git commands to add changes, check status and logs, and commit often with meaningful messages. For this project, I will be creating a recipes web page using HTML.
